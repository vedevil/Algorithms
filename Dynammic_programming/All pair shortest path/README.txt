Program is implemented in 3 steps:

Step 1:Taking input as all the vertices(as a string) and all the edges of the graph
Step 2: Making adjancency matrix with a condition if direct eddge is not present between two vertices, then distance is taken infinity.
Ste3: Main step of the algo
We are considering every intermediate vertex and checking if the path via that vertex is etter than direct edge.

Input format
Line 1 takes vertices of the graph as a  string
Line 2 takes all the eges of the graph along with  weight.
