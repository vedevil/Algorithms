Refrence: Algorithms course by abdul sir

Brief: Program uses bottomup approach to get each value of matrix.
It first calculates min operation required to multiply 2 matrices, then 3 and so on...
We need another matrix to track where parenthesis are to be put.

Time:O(n^3)

Input format:
First line takes no. of matrices

Next n lines take input as dimensions of n matrices /
where each line is seperated by space eg., noofrows noofcolumns
